## [SDF10] API Learning Reflection ðŸ§ 

Welcome to the [SDF10] API Learning Reflection! Through this exercise, you will reflect on key concepts, practical experiences, and the tools you've encountered or used in API interactions.

1. **Understanding and Application**: Reflecting on the key concepts, can you explain in your own words what an API is and its significance in software development? Provide an example of how you have used or encountered an API in a project or a practical scenario.

An application programming interface when the software communicates with another software to get data from it like for example to delete, post, get resources from the server.

2. **Conceptual Distinctions**: How would you differentiate between an interface and an API? 

An interface is a broard way of viewing communication between 2 users or systems like for example when you interacte with a screen using a keyboard or a mouse, that is a user and system communicating, an interface. An API is when you can use an already existing software to build your own application, it is a software to software communication, where an app can get a specific 
authorization from a server to get or delete a resourse like a weather app getting weather information to display on your app.

3. **Components and Types of APIs**: Can you identify the main components of an API and describe their roles? Reflect on the different types of APIs mentioned (e.g., Web APIs, RESTful APIs) and discuss which type you find most intriguing or useful, and why.

Web API is where you can get information about that specific company and interact with it's data. I find Web API more interesting because you can get an idea how full all websites work by communicating with each other and how you can use the spotify id's to get a more specific resource about it, usually the URL has an endpoint to get that specific data.

4. **Practical Application and Tools**: Reflect on your experience with API exploration and implementation. Have you used any specific tools (such as Curl or API exploration tools) or libraries to interact with APIs? 

I have used cURL to get the resources using http and see the resources I got from the servers locally on the command prompt. The helper libraries are so useful that they are programming tasks that can be used more than once, like for example a volume, the API of it is constant and will be forever be used.

5. **Learning and Improvement**: Considering the key concepts and your practical experiences, identify one area related to APIs where you feel confident and one area where you see a need for improvement. What steps will you take to enhance your understanding and skills in the area you wish to improve?

More practical usage of API will make it easier for me to understand, so hopfully I can get my hands dirty to work on APIs, this will improve my theory understanding of it more.
